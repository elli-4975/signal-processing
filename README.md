## Signal Processing & Matrix Math – Programming Project

**Ellie McGregor**  
UBC Biomedical Engineering

This project showcases my work with recursive and matrix-based algorithms, signal processing for ECG data, and image analysis for neuron detection.

### Fibonacci Sequence

- Implemented both recursive and matrix exponentiation approaches.
- Compared performance:  
  - Recursive (fib 40) ≈ 34s  
  - Matrix ≈ <1s

### ECG Heartbeat Detection

- Processed raw binary ECG signals.
- Used 1D cross-correlation to detect heartbeats.
- Implemented both for-loop and matrix math methods.
- Identified arrhythmia patterns based on inconsistent heartbeat timing.

### Neuron Identification

- Analyzed fluorescent neuron images.
- Used 2D cross-correlation with a neuron template.
- Detected both red and green neurons in an RGB image.

### Skills Demonstrated

- Numerical methods & optimization
- Signal & image processing in Python
- Matrix algebra and vectorization
- Scientific plotting and data export (CSV)
